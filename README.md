# EquityX-L00160463
Stock Market and Cryptocurrency app


You have been hired to create a cross platform application EquityX that allows users to
simulate the trading of various equities such as stocks and crypto currencies. You have a
large degree of creative control over the visual design of the application and supported
features, however the final EquityX application should at a minimum, support the following
core functional elements:
• Add and withdraw funds to and from the application. – Funds should be in USD
and are used to buy assets (stocks and cryptocurrencies). I can only withdraw <= the
total USD cash balance within the application. Assets are not automatically sold if I
attempt to withdraw >= my current USD cash balance.
• Simulate the purchase and sale of assets (equity also known as stocks or
cryptocurrencies) from a variety of markets (FTSE, Dow, DASDAQ, et cetera).
• Display live market information on assets (stock or cryptocurrencies).
• Display the total value of all assets (including available funds) within my
portfolio(s).
• Display summary information on my investments. This may be individual assets
such as Microsoft stocks, all assets of a particular type (crypto currencies or all
equity). For example, I may have purchased 10 units of Microsoft stock each month
for three months. I should see the cost of each individual purchase, the difference
based on the current live value of Microsoft stock and my overall profit or loss for
each purchase and my entire holding of Microsoft stock.
• Persistent storage of trading data (historical purchases and sales of assets).
